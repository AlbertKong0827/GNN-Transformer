# Crop Yield Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict the annual crop yields accurately based on features like weather, soil, management, etc. On top of this, we hope to make the prediction as early as possible.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- PyTorch 1.0+

Older versions might work as well.

## Data

Sample crop yield dataset is stored in `data/` and the nation-wise adjacency map is stored in `map/`.
